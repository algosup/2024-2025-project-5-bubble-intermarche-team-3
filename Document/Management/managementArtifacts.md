## Key Performance Indicators
### Definition of our KPIs

To keep track of the project's advancement, KPIs have been defined. These KPIs are listed below in their respective categories, along with the reasoning behind each.

**Documents**

The following KPIs are included in this section:

- Functional specifications
- Technical specifications
- Test Plan
- User Manual

The progress of these documents is measured using the following formula:

$$\text{percentage} = (\frac{\text{current number of sections}} {\text{total number of sections}})\times{100}$$
Where :

*current_number_of_sections:* The number of sections that are completely done.

*total_number_of_sections:* The number of predefined sections in the document's outline, which may evolve.

**Design**

The KPIs in this section include:

- First Mock-ups
- Final Mock-up

The percentage progress for these KPIs is calculated using this formula:

$$\text{percentage} = (\frac{\text{current number of designed pages}} {\text{total number of pages to design}})\times{100}$$

Where :

- *current_number_of_pages_designed*: The number of pages that have been prototyped.
- *total_number_of_pages_to_design*: The total number of pages planned to be designed during the project analysis.


**Development**

The KPIs in this section include:
- Database
- Filter
- Design Page

The percentage progress for these KPIs is calculated using this formula:

$$\text{percentage} = (\frac{\text{the current number of tasks to do}} {\text{total number of tasks}})\times{100}$$

Where :
- *the_current_number_of_tasks_to_do*: It's the number of tasks done at the time.
- *total_number_of_tasks*: 
It's the number of small tasks to be done in total.

**Human Resources**

The following KPIs are tracked in this section:
- Overtime
- Unjustified Absence

All this information is collected through a form, which is sent to each teammate at the end of every week.

**Mood**

In the weekly form, team members rate their mood for the week on a scale of 1 to 10.<br>

To calculate the percentage of these KPIs, we add up all the team members' responses and compare the total to the maximum possible score.

The percentage for these KPIs is calculated using this formula:
$$\text{percentage} = (\frac{\text{total responses}} {\text{max possible score}})\times{100}$$

Where :
- *total responses* : the addition of all the team members' responses.
- *max possible score* : the maximum possible score(10*team members' number).

## Addendum
### Differences Between Gantt Chart and Actual Schedule

The project schedule deviated from the initial Gantt Chart due to several factors, which will be explained in this section.

Firstly, the team got a considerable head start on certain tasks, notably The Technical Specifications, which could be started immediately after finalization of the mock-up.

Secondly, thanks to rigorous preparation and efficient fine-tuning from the outset of the project, everyone had a clear vision of the objectives. This enabled us to work more efficiently, to divide tasks optimally, and to help each other, which accelerated the pace compared with forecasts.

Finally, some weeks were more complicated due to numerous absences, resulting in variations in productivity at different weeks.
