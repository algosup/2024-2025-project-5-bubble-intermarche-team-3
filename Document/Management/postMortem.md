## Mad, Sad, Glad

|Team Member | Mad | Sad | Glad|
|-|-|-|-|
|Léna DE GERMAIN | Nothing | I didn’t organize my documents in the best order; I should have started earlier on some of them. | Good rapport and team cohesion. <br> The application is really well done.|
|Julian REINE | The database provided by the client lacked essential information to be fully understood and properly implemented. | I could have been more involved; instead of just asking how to help others, I should have taken action myself.| Good teamwork and mutual support among team members.|
|Guillaume DESPAUX| The Bubble platform was not well-suited for the project, which caused issues during the development of the web application.<br> The frequent absences of team members. <br>  | I was unable to implement a working filter in the search bar. <br> The design lacked polish and overall quality. | The application itself, along with the development and research of algorithms and databases. <br> The fact that we adhered to the rule of speaking English during project hours.|
|Vivien Bistrel TSANGUE CHOUNGOU|Nothing| The frequent absences of team members.| Testing the application was fun. |
|Lucas AUBARD| The program manager left during the project | The database provided by the client lacked essential information. | Everyone was involved in the project. |

- Do more testing on the application.
## Conclusion
This project gave us a real opportunity to grow. The obstacles we encountered and the mistakes we made provided valuable lessons that will undoubtedly lead to a more thoughtful and efficient approach in our future work.
