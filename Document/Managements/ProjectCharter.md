## Project definition
This project aims to create a web application that recommends which wine or cheese to pair with a dish.

The client is the retail chain "Intermarché", more specifically the Intermarché of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. Our contact points are Célia, The supermarket's quality assurance, and Chrys, an apprentice.

## Scope

This project should be done using the no-code platform Bubble, and be compatible with any type of of phone.

The application will be fast and accessible, it must be easy to use to avoid a waste of time for the client.

### MOSCOW

We created a MoSCoW for the project to better understand what we will and won’t include.

This is the MosCoW made for the project :

## Project Plan

On April 25th, 2025, we had a meeting with the clients to explain in detail the project and answer the questions we had.<br>
It was decided that additional questions would be sent via email. To avoid duplicate questions and reduce the volume of messages that clients need to respond to, we agreed that all Program Managers will share the questions and answers they receive with each other and update them in a Google Sheet.

To manage the various tasks and track each teammate's progress, we will use a GitHub repository to centralize all resources and documents.<br>
Additionally, we will use Google Drive to store our research throughout the project, and we will use Slack as our means of communication.


This project will adopt the Waterfall project management method due to the limited timeframe. However, we will also incorporate some aspects of Scrum. By combining these methodologies, we can ensure the project is completed despite time constraints.

One day before the final presentation, scheduled for June 20, 2025, we will conduct a post-mortem analysis to summarize the project outcomes and prepare a report for the client.
