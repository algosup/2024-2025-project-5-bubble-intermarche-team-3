# Functional Specification - Intermarché Wine & Cheese Recommendation App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional specifications for the development of a mobile-friendly web application for Intermarché Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. The application will provide wine and cheese recommendations to customers based on their culinary preferences or occasions. The project aims to enhance customer experience while increasing store revenue, particularly targeting tourists with high purchasing power in this touristic region.
