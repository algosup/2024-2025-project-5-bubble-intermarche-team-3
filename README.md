# 🧀🍷 Intermarché Wine & Cheese Pairing Web App

Welcome to the official repository for the **Intermarché Wine & Cheese Pairing Web Application** – a mobile-friendly digital sommelier built with Bubble for Intermarché Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.
This application provides personalized wine and cheese recommendations based on selected recipes, ingredients, or scanned barcodes. Designed for quick in-store use, it requires no installation and works offline after initial load. Targeted primarily at tourists and local customers, the app supports both French and English.
