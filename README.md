# Technical Specifications – Team 3

Welcome to the **TechnicalSpecifications** directory for the "Bubble Intermarché" project, developed by Team 3 as part of fifth and last project of the year 2025.

## Purpose

This document serves as the technical pillar of the project. It outlines in detail the application's structure, architecture, technology used, development environment, and workflow strategy. The goal is to provide developers, stakeholders and future maintainers explanation for how the app works and how it was built.

## Summary

This project is an application developed using **Bubble.io**, a no-code development platform, for the **Intermarché supermarket of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence**. It is designed to help users—especially tourists—explore and discover **wine and cheese pairings** based on stock availability of this intermarché and traditional French gastronomy.

### Key Highlights

- **Modular GitHub architecture** with conflict-free branching and automated merge checks.
- **Frontend design** includes Main, Filter, Research, Product, and Favorites pages.
- **Backend logic** built using Bubble workflows and Firebase API integration for external data management.
- **Structured database design** representing wines, cheeses, origins, and food pairings.
- **Extensive use of Bubble features**, including the API Connector, custom states, and responsive engine.
- **Commit, comment, and naming conventions** to ensure team consistency.
- **Testing & risk mitigation strategies** integrated into the development process.
